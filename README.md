# HUB-ipython
HUB (Heidelberg Unseminars in Bioinformatics) about IPython and chemoinformatics

## Location and date
BioMed X, Im Neuenheimer feld 583, Heidelbeg, mid January 2016

#### Current plans are to include in this:

* an ice-breaker - maybe the 'classic' standing in a line/grid to describe our experience coding, which we can also use for teaming people up for later activities - a group of experienced coders goes to the part of the room where people haven't done any coding before, and we find experienced partners for each of them
* a demo from Samo of IPython in this chemoinformatic context
* maybe someone else demos something similar using a different language (R? Perl?)
* pair-programming together, using examples from [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) exercises (and some additional [chemoinfo](exercises/README.md) excercises)

angle we'd use to publicise the event would be:

* never coded before? come and try out coding with experts, to see what it's like
* interested in seeing what iPython/jupyter can do? come along and check it out - especially if you're into chemoinformatics - note that similar stuff is available for other languages
* chance to try out pair programming

For this, we'll ideally have a bunch of people joining the event who will bring their own laptops, have appropriate software set up and running, so that we have enough laptops to pair-program with everyone - if not, maybe we try doing it in groups of 3.
